# NEAT AI

## Meta Talk

- Evolutionary AI guy
- "Ghetto AI" creator
- lychee.js Engine
- artificial.engineering

## Meta Talk

I prefer backpropagated ES/HyperBNEAT
over everything (including sleep), but
this is an Absolute Beginner-Level talk.

## Disclaimer

- I am a practical AI guy
- I use backpropagated CARTEL-ES/HyperBNEAT
- I love automated labor
- I hate manual labor
- I also do hate maths and doctors
- ML guys probably hate me anyways

## Disclaimer

I tend to say fuck a lot.
At least I'm honest about it.

## Genetic Programming

- Idea is to represent data as DNA
- DNA can be combined with others
- Imagine DNA as an "Array of values"
- Values can also be weights of an NN :)

## Genetic Programming

## Evolution Basics

- Evolution has three phases
- Phase 1 is Training
- Phase 2 is Evaluation
- Phase 3 is Breeding

## Evolution Basics

![evolution](/asset/evolution.png)

## Evolution Basics

- After each Epoche / Cycle:
- Population gets killed and replaced
- Some of them are Mutants
- Some of them are Survivors
- Only the best ones get to breed

## Evolution Basics

![genome-nn](/asset/genome-nn.png)

## Evolution Basics

- Always a Multi-Agent system
- Always a competitive environment
- Agent gets rewarded or punished
- Agent has fitness as status
- Fittest agents get to breed/multiply


= NEAT

# NEAT

## NEAT

- Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies
- Adaptive neural network algorithm
- builds neural networks from scratch

## NEAT

- learns how to build ANNs
- learns the behaviour of ANNs
- learns the performance of ANNs

## NEAT

- is technically an unsupervised system
- adapts to new problems and datasets
- understands relations of problems and solutions
- remembers solutions in the form of DNA (genes)


= Network

# Network

## Network

- Neural Network is adaptive
- Per-Neuron graph structure
- Neurons have multiple connections
- Connections have weights

## Network

![adaptive-nn](/asset/adaptive-nn.png)

## Network

- is not data-specific
- only requires input matrix / input array
- bias neuron is an "always on" node

## Network

![adaptive-neat-nn](/asset/adaptive-neat-nn.png)

## Network

- Bias Mutations
- Link Mutations
- Node (Neuron) Mutations

## Network

- Neuron connections are weighted
- (not in NEAT: Weight Mutations)
- (not in NEAT: Backpropagation)


= Pool

# Pool

## Pool

- Pool represents evolution's population
- has multiple generations of species
- keeps track of innovations

## Pool

- keeps track of current species
- keeps track of current genome(s)
- keeps track of maximum fitness(es)

## Pool

- Multiple Species represent a Pool
- measures Species by fitness / average fitness
- sorts Species by performance
- sorts Species by behaviour/complexity


= Species

# Species

## Species

- NEAT divides characteristics in species
- Multiple agents represent one specie(s)
- Breeding happens per-species, not per-agent


= Genome

# Genome

## Genome

Idea is to represent a neural network
in the form of DNA, so that it can be
measured, tracked, enhanced and advanced
using breeding mechanisms.

## Genome

- represents mutations
- measured via innovation count
- has fitness and adjusted fitness
- has multiple genes

## Gene

- one gene is one neuron connection
- can be enabled (dominant)
- can be disabled (recessive)
- is also weighted
- (weight can be backpropagated)

## Gene
